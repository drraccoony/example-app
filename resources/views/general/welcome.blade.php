                                it if you help us out. The name of the game is to join a team with your friends or
                                against your friends and log your activity points as you explore the convention.</p>
                            <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">As you explore the convention area you might see some
                                signs with QR codes that look like
                                this:

                                by scanning the QR code with your
                                smart phone camera and visiting the website (CAREFUL! There might be shifty foxes out
                                there swapping codes, the website should look like
                                https://beta.event-dev.com/log/1). You'll see a big green
                                indicator saying it worked or a red one saying you already logged that activity. That's
                                all you have to do!</p>

                            <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Currently there is no prize for the winning team, big
                                sad üôÅ , but we're hoping to get
                                this out for other conventions to use and maybe they'll have a prize for the winners!
